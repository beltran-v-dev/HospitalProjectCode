# HospitalProjectCode

Hospital Project is the project in which I am currently working alongside a
classmate. In this project, our main character will have to find her way out of a hospital
crawling with zombies. This project will be finished in December 2023.

In this repository you'll find the c++ code used to make this game 

My tasks: In this project, I am also taking on the project manager role. As a programmer, I am writing
most of the logic in C++ (character movement, shooting system, AI...), animations with
blend spaces, and creating custom blueprints from C++.

If you want to follow the progress week by week you can take a look at the following twitter thread:
